# Fingerprint GUI

Fingerprint GUI is an application providing fingerprint-based authentication on
Linux desktops. Based on the libfprint library, it features a simple GUI for
fingerprint management and a PAM module. Additionally, you may install the
bundled non-free libbsapi library, in which case Fingerprint GUI will
automatically support all fingerprint readers manufactured by UPEK, Inc.

## Supported hardware

The list of fingerprint readers supported by libfprint is available [here](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/supported-devices.html).

If you install the libbsapi library, then all hardware by UPEK should be
supported as well.

## Compilation

### Prepare the build environment

This project is built using the Qt 5 development framework. The required
packages can be installed on any recent Debian-based Linux distributions with
the command:

```bash
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a qt5ct qt5-qmake qtchooser \
qttranslations5-l10n qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools libqt5x11extras5-dev \
  qttools5-dev
```

### Install dependencies

In order to compile the software you will need cmake and the development
packages for libfprint, libqca-qt5-2, libfakekey, libusb-1.0, libpolkit-qt5-1
and libpam.

If you are running a recent Debian-based distribution, use the
following command:

```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake cmake-extras libfprint-dev libqca-qt5-2-dev \
libfakekey-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libpolkit-qt5-1-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### Create the build directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

### Generate the Makefile

```bash
cmake ..
```

#### Installation paths

By default, everything gets installed under `/usr/local/`. If you want to
change the prefix to `/usr/`, you can alter the cmake invocation like this:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
```

Additionally, libraries are installed into
`$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/$CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, helper executables go into
`$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/$CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR`, and the PAM module is
installed into `$CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR/security`. The default value for both
`$CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and `$CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR` is `/lib`, which should
be suitable for most Linux distributions.

However, should you need to adjust the value of these two variables, you can
set them in the same way as `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` above. For instance, on
recent 64-bit Fedora systems you would invoke cmake like this:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/lib64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR=/libexec ..
```

or with

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/lib64 \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR=/libexec ..
```

if you want to install into `/usr`.

### Build the software

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Install the compiled software

```bash
sudo make install
```

### Add support for UPEK readers (install the bundled proprietary library `libbsapi`)

```bash
sudo make install-upek
```

### Upgrading from older versions

Beginning with version 1.07 of Fingerprint GUI, the ownership and
permissions of users' fingerprint data in `/var/lib/fingerprint-gui/` has been
changed. To apply the new ownership and permissions needed for version 1.07 and
above to fingerprint data from an older version, run:

```bash
sudo make user-data
```

## Account membership

Please note that every user that wants to use this library must be member of
group `plugdev`. This group is created automatically. The following command
will add your current user account to the `plugdev` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $(id -un)
```

## PAM configuration

See the following guides for instructions on how to modify your PAM stack to
enable fingerprint-based authentication:
